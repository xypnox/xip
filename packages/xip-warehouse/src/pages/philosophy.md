## Customization

Customization is offered in various degrees of freedom.

- Either an interface is of a fixed static theme,
- Or certain aspects of the theme(s) change

Usually two modes are offered, light and dark both denoting the overarching lightness of the theme in the respective modes.

Sometimes colors are offered, sometimes those colors have specific styles linked with them. Sometimes changing a single color changes several related colors with it.

The more common and frequently used an interface is,  
The more powerful customization makes it.
